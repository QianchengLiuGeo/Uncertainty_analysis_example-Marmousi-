Visualization for Posterior Sampling (credited to Daniel Peter).

1. The a.out in the files of the main folder is produced by pre_plot.c with

gcc pre_plot.c -o a.out -lm -O2

2. Users with interest can use outfile.m in the main folder to directly output the Eigenvectors or Random Fields for visualization.
